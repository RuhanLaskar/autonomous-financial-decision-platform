# autonomous-financial-decision-platform
Data engineering, data science, AI/ML, and full-stack systems are all integrated into this end-to-end autonomous, data-agnostic financial intelligence and decision platform.



This project aims to design and build a fully autonomous, data-agnostic financial intelligence and decision-making platform.

Unlike traditional data science or web-based systems, this platform is modeled as an autonomous agent capable of:
- Observing incoming financial data streams
- Learning behavioral patterns automatically
- Making risk-aware decisions without human intervention
- Adapting to new data types and distributions over time

The project follows a **Git-first, documentation-driven, and system-design-oriented approach**, reflecting real-world AI engineering practices.

## Core Domains Covered
- Data Engineering
- Data Science
- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Full Stack System Integration

> The frontend, if present, acts only as an observability layer.  
> All intelligence, decision-making, and learning occur autonomously in the backend.
